# Optically-Activated Delayed Fluorescence Lifetime Plotter

## Overview

This Python script is designed to plot optically-activated delayed fluorescence lifetime (OADF) data measured from the National Instrument photon counting board. The script offers a user-friendly GUI for file selection, supports up to 4 traces visualization in one figure, and provides customization options for plot titles, curve names, and zoomed-in views.

## Features

- **GUI File Selection:** Users can easily select the raw data file using a graphical user interface.
  
- **Multi-Traces Visualization:** The script supports up to 4 traces to visualize in a single figure.
  
- **Customizable Plot Titles and Curve Names:** Users can type in custom plot titles and curve names for better data interpretation.
  
- **Zoomed-In View with Inset:** An inset can be added to the plot for a zoomed-in view, allowing users to focus on specific time and intensity ranges.

# Fluorescence Spectrum Plotter

## Overview

This Python script provides a user-friendly GUI for plotting fluorescence spectra using excitation and emission data. Users can easily assign the plot title and select the files they want to plot, and the script will automatically generate the corresponding fluorescence spectrum. Additionally, users have the option to save the plotted spectrum to a specified folder. 

## Features

- **User-Friendly GUI:** The script features a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to easily select excitation and emission data files for plotting.

- **Automatic Plotting:** Once the user assigns the plot title and selects the data files through the GUI, the script automatically generates and displays the fluorescence spectrum plot.

- **Save Plot Option:** Users can save the plotted fluorescence spectrum by clicking the "Save Plot" button. The plot will be saved in a folder chosen by the user.

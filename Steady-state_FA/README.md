# Fluorescence Anisotropy Calculator

## Overview

This Python script calculates fluorescence anisotropy from fluorescence spectrum data. The script takes fluorescence intensity data from both vertical and horizontal polarizations and calculates the anisotropy values. Additionally, the script plots both the fluorescence spectrum and the calculated fluorescence anisotropy, allowing users to visualize the data. Users also have the option to save the plots to a specified folder.

## Features

- **Fluorescence Anisotropy Calculation:** The script calculates fluorescence anisotropy using fluorescence intensity data from both vertical and horizontal polarizations.
  
- **Automatic Plotting:** The script automatically generates and displays plots for both the fluorescence spectrum and the calculated fluorescence anisotropy.
  
- **Save Plot Option:** Users can save the plotted fluorescence spectrum and anisotropy plots by clicking the "Save Plot" button. The plots will be saved in a folder chosen by the user.


## Usage

1. Run the script.
2. Read the fluorescence intensity data for both vertical and horizontal polarizations.
3. The script will calculate fluorescence anisotropy and plot both the fluorescence spectrum and anisotropy.
4. Click the "Save Plot" button to save the plots to a specified folder.
